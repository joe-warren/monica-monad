# Monica Monad

In ["The Great 2009 Haskell Logo Contest"](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_logos/New_logo_ideas), one of the submissions was a character called "Monica Monad", submitted by user "FalconNL", and described as a "Warm Fuzzy Thing" (putting a face to SPJ's alternative name for monads).

This repo represents my attempt to build out a more fully fleshed set of "Monica Monad" assets, 17 years after the character was created.
